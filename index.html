                        <p>Born in 1911 and passed away in 2005, Jose P. Alcantara was a renowned Filipino sculptor, muralist, painter, inventor and businessman. Alcantara is remembered for his contributions to the rich and diverse Filipino art scene, and is known as one of the greatest sculptors that the country has ever produced.
                            <br />
                            <br/>A native of Manila, Alcantara began his career in art at the age of ten as an apprentice in a sculptural shop in the Quiapo district. He would go on to hone his craft over the course of his lifetime, and go on to win multiple prizes in competitions held by the Art Association of the Philippines, as well as various awards in the United States where he emigrated later in life.
                            <br />
                            <br />Alcantara rests today with his wife, Elisa, and his eldest daughter, Julieta, in a cemetery in the town of Taytay in Rizal province, nearby the familial hometown of Binangonan. He has children and grandchildren that currently live in the Philippines and around the world, many of which continue to carry on his legacy in the arts.</p>
